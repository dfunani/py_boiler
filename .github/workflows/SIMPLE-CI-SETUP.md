# Simple CI/CD Setup ✅

You're absolutely right! For your py_boiler project, you only need **2 workflow files**:

## 📁 What You Actually Need

### 1. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - Main CI Pipeline
- **Tests**: Runs on Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 across Ubuntu, Windows, macOS
- **Linting**: Ruff linting and formatting checks
- **Build**: Package building and validation
- **Triggers**: Push to any branch, Pull requests to main/develop

### 2. **`.github/workflows/python-publish.yml`** - PyPI Publishing
- **Publishing**: Automatically publishes to PyPI when you create a GitHub release
- **Triggers**: When you create a release on GitHub
- **Security**: Uses GitHub's trusted publishing (no API tokens needed)

## 🚀 How It Works

### For Development:
1. **Push code** → `ci.yml` runs tests and linting
2. **Create PR** → `ci.yml` runs tests and linting
3. **Merge to main** → `ci.yml` runs tests and linting

### For Releases:
1. **Create a GitHub release** → `python-publish.yml` automatically publishes to PyPI
2. **No manual steps needed** - it's fully automated!

## 🎯 What This Gives You

✅ **Automated Testing** - Tests run on every push/PR  
✅ **Code Quality** - Ruff linting and formatting  
✅ **Multi-Platform** - Tests on Ubuntu, Windows, macOS  
✅ **Multi-Version** - Tests on Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12  
✅ **Coverage** - 97% test coverage reporting  
✅ **PyPI Publishing** - Automatic publishing on release  

## 🔧 Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync --dev

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v --cov=py_boiler

# Run linting
ruff check src/ tests/
ruff format src/ tests/

# Build package
python -m build
twine check dist/*
```

## 📊 Status Badges

Your README now shows:
- Test suite status
- Code quality status
- Coverage percentage

## 🎉 That's It!

You now have a simple, effective CI/CD pipeline with just 2 files:
- `ci.yml` - For testing and quality checks
- `python-publish.yml` - For PyPI publishing

No need for complex workflows, security scans, or dependency management - just the essentials! 🚀
